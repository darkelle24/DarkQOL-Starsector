# DarkQOL Project

## Core Features

### 1. Add Different Tiers for the Reverse Engineering Building

- [x] Define tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
- [ ] Add unique effects or bonuses for each tier.
- [ ] Ensure higher tiers unlock new functionalities or improve existing ones.

### 2. Adjust Reverse Time Based on Item Type (Weapons, Wings, Ships)

- [ ] Define base reverse times for each item type.
- [ ] Implement a system to adjust reverse time based on the item type.

### 3. Adjust Reverse Time Based on Ship Size

- [ ] Add a "size" property to ships (small, medium, large).
- [ ] Define time multipliers for each size category.
- [ ] Implement reverse time calculation based on ship size.

### 4. Manage AI Time Reduction Using Percentages Instead of Raw Values

- [ ] Replace the current raw value system with percentages.
- [ ] Define percentage reductions based on AI level.
- [ ] Implement the final reverse time calculation using percentages.

### 5. Add Tier-Based Error Messages for Items

- [x] Identify error cases (e.g., tier too low to reverse an item).
- [x] Create clear and informative error messages.
- [x] Implement these messages in the user interface.

## New Functionalities

### 6. Create a Building That Spawns a Gate Near the Planet

- [ ] Design a new "Gate Spawner" building.
- [ ] Implement the functionality to spawn a gate near the planet.
- [ ] Define costs and conditions for using the building.

### 7. Create an Item That Spawns a Temporary Gate

- [ ] Design a new "Temporary Gate" item.
- [ ] Implement the functionality to spawn a temporary gate.
- [ ] Define the gate's lifespan and usage conditions.

### 8. Create a Research Item That Can Be Produced by a Special Building

- [ ] Design a new "Research Item."
- [ ] Create a special building to produce the research item.
- [ ] Define resources and time required to produce the item.

### 9. Use the Research Item to Activate the Reverse Engineering Building

- [ ] Link the research item to the reverse engineering building.
- [ ] Implement a system where the item is consumed to activate reverse engineering.

## Visual Improvements

### 10. Create Unique Images for Each Tier of the Reverse Engineering Building

- [ ] Design unique visuals for each tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, etc.).
- [ ] Integrate the new images into the game.
- [ ] Ensure the correct image is displayed based on the selected tier.
